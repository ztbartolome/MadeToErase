What is this place?
Erased? I must've been put here by mistake. Do you know the way out?
But I need to get back to my engineers as soon as possible! They were so close to fixing my glitch.
Well, that's one way of putting it. But I'm sure my engineers will fix me!
That was amazing! Thank you!
But you weren't programmed specifically to help clear my path. So thank you.
Once I get out of here, maybe I can find some way to visit so you won't be alone all the time.
Woah!
I understand. It's good that your code is working so well. I wish mine could too.
