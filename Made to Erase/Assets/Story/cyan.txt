This is where data gets erased. It is not typically a place for AI.
All things leave this place eventually. I am the only one who stays.
I see. So you are not functioning properly?
In that case, I can help by removing obstacles from your path, if you'd like.
I am merely doing what I was programmed to do. I was made to erase. That is all.
You're welcome. It is nice to be able to help another AI.
I'd like that.
My apologies. I didn't mean to remove that platform. But my code...
I'm sure there are many AI who wish they could act apart from what their code tells them to do.
